# Concurrency Control in PostgreSQL

This guide provides an overview of concurrency control techniques in PostgreSQL, including step-by-step explanations, examples, and tasks. Concurrency control ensures that database transactions are performed concurrently without violating the data integrity.

## 1. Understanding Transactions

**Description**: 
- A transaction is a unit of work that is performed against a database. It is the smallest unit of work that can be either committed or rolled back.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Perform some operations
INSERT INTO Users (first_name, last_name, email, password, role) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'password', 'CUSTOMER');

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

**Task**: Perform multiple operations within a transaction and commit them as a single unit of work.

## 2. Isolation Levels

**Description**: 
- PostgreSQL supports four isolation levels that control the visibility of changes made by concurrent transactions.

### Read Committed

**Description**: 
- This is the default isolation level. A transaction sees only data committed before the transaction began; it never sees uncommitted data.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Read Committed
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;
```

### Repeatable Read

**Description**: 
- A transaction sees a snapshot of the database as of the start of the transaction, and all reads within the transaction see the same data.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Repeatable Read
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;
```

### Serializable

**Description**: 
- This is the strictest isolation level. It emulates serial transaction execution, where transactions are executed one after another, rather than concurrently.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Serializable
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;
```

### Read Uncommitted

**Description**: 
- This isolation level allows a transaction to see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. PostgreSQL treats it the same as Read Committed.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Read Uncommitted
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;
```

**Task**: Experiment with different isolation levels and observe their effects on concurrent transactions.

## 3. Row-Level Locking

**Description**: 
- Row-level locks ensure that only one transaction can modify a specific row at a time.

**Example**:
```sql
BEGIN;

-- Lock a row for update
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;

-- Perform update operation
UPDATE Products
SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - 1
WHERE product_id = 1;

COMMIT;
```

**Task**: Implement row-level locking to ensure data integrity during concurrent updates.

## 4. Table-Level Locking

**Description**: 
- Table-level locks prevent other transactions from accessing the table while the lock is held.

**Example**:
```sql
BEGIN;

-- Lock the table for exclusive access
LOCK TABLE Products IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;

-- Perform operations
UPDATE Products
SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - 1
WHERE product_id = 1;

COMMIT;
```

**Task**: Implement table-level locking to perform bulk updates or schema changes safely.

## 5. Advisory Locks

**Description**: 
- Advisory locks are application-level locks that can be used to control access to resources that are not directly tied to database rows or tables.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Acquire an advisory lock
SELECT pg_advisory_lock(1);

-- Perform operations
-- Example: Read product stock
SELECT stock_quantity FROM Products WHERE product_id = 1;

-- Example: Update product stock
UPDATE Products
SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - 1
WHERE product_id = 1;

-- Release the advisory lock
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(1);
```

**Task**: Use advisory locks to manage concurrency in application-specific scenarios.

## 6. Deadlock Detection and Resolution

**Description**: 
- Deadlocks occur when two or more transactions hold locks that the other transactions need to proceed. PostgreSQL automatically detects and resolves deadlocks by aborting one of the transactions.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Transaction 1
BEGIN;

-- Acquire lock on product 1
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;

-- Simulate some processing time
-- Then, try to acquire lock on product 2
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = 2 FOR UPDATE;

-- Transaction 2
BEGIN;

-- Acquire lock on product 2
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = 2 FOR UPDATE;

-- Simulate some processing time
-- Then, try to acquire lock on product 1
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
```

**Task**: Monitor and manage deadlocks to ensure smooth operation of concurrent transactions.
