# Isolation Levels in PostgreSQL

This guide provides an overview of the isolation levels in PostgreSQL, including explanations, examples, and use cases. Isolation levels control the visibility of changes made by concurrent transactions and ensure data integrity.

## 1. Read Committed

**Description**: 
- The default isolation level in PostgreSQL. A transaction sees only data committed before the transaction began; it never sees uncommitted data.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Read Committed
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;
```

**Use Case**: Suitable for most applications where dirty reads are not acceptable, but some level of concurrency is desired.

## 2. Repeatable Read

**Description**: 
- A transaction sees a snapshot of the database as of the start of the transaction, and all reads within the transaction see the same data, providing higher consistency.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Repeatable Read
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;
```

**Use Case**: Use when consistent reads are necessary, but some concurrency is still required. Prevents non-repeatable reads.

## 3. Serializable

**Description**: 
- The strictest isolation level, emulating serial transaction execution. It ensures complete isolation, where transactions appear to be executed one after another, rather than concurrently.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Serializable
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;
```

**Use Case**: Use when full isolation is required, and data consistency is critical, despite reduced concurrency.

## 4. Read Uncommitted

**Description**: 
- This isolation level allows a transaction to see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. In PostgreSQL, it behaves the same as Read Committed.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Read Uncommitted
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;
```

**Use Case**: Rarely used in PostgreSQL since it behaves like Read Committed, and dirty reads are generally undesirable.

## Summary of Isolation Levels

1. **Read Committed**: Default level, prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
2. **Repeatable Read**: Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads, but allows phantom reads.
3. **Serializable**: Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads, providing full isolation.
4. **Read Uncommitted**: Allows dirty reads but behaves like Read Committed in PostgreSQL.

These isolation levels provide different trade-offs between consistency and concurrency, allowing developers to choose the level that best fits their applicationâ€™s requirements.
